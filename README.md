# Statistics and probability - Project 4 Regression Analysis
This project, "Regression Analysis," was completed individually. The task is to build an Android app that estimates shoe size based on user-provided height using linear regression. The app should display the estimated shoe size and, optionally, the correlation coefficient and grade. A RegressionLine class is implemented to calculate regression coefficients (k and m) using the least squares method, as well as a method to estimate shoe size (getX()). Advanced functionality includes calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and determining correlation grade.
